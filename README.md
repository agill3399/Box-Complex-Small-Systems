# Box-Complex-Small-Systems
This code works for both the Martin County and Whitesburg Systems. It will be improved for improved levels of data and pump times being used in the system (as well as elevations of tanks etc.) By doing this you will also rapidly increase the speed at which this data is processed. 

Please see the attached video for more information.
